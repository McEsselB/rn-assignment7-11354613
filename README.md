# DCIT 202 (MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT)

### Assignment 7

### STUDENT ID : 11354613

# Description of Task

This is the seventh assignment for the DCIT 202 (Mobile Application Development) course. The task involves developing a mobile application as part of an assignment for a mobile application development course. The application is an e-commerce app that allows users to view a list of products, view product details, add products to a cart, remove products from the cart, and view the items in their cart. The task requires the implementation of several components and features, including data fetching, local storage, and asynchronous operations.

# App Overview

The e-commerce mobile application allows users to browse through a list of available products fetched from an external API. Users can view detailed information about each product, add products to their cart, remove products from their cart, and view the contents of their cart. The app provides a seamless shopping experience with an easy-to-navigate interface and persistent local storage to maintain the cart's state.

# Development Tools Used for App Build.

- Expo Go, for real-time preview.
- Android Studio Emulator, for
- Expo CLI, for lanching development server.
- Visual Studio Code, for writing code managing files and folders.

## Steps I used to create a new React Native blank template project using Expo CLI.

- Run `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Run `expo init  fashion-commerce -- template blank`
- Run `cd fashion-commerce` to navigate into the project directory
- Run `npm run android` to start the development server
- Enter `a` to select `open on android`
